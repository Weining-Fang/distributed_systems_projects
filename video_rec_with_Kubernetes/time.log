I discussed my solution with: ChatGPT 4o.

One challenging part of this lab for me is to understand the internal workflow 
of Kubernetes: how it pulls the local docker container image, set up a deployment 
start running the service on a pod, configure the deployment to run in the cluster, 
expose the deployment with a service, and set up load tests as well as connection 
pooling. Although the lab spec are clear to follow, I sometimes still feel confused 
about the relationship between different objects and structures. During debugging I 
also got to know that there are quite some operations that grpc has abstracted to run 
underhood (for example, distributing load requests to different backing pods despite 
single connection set up.) I hope we can get more hands-on experience to further 
familiarize ourselves with Kubernetes and grpc in the future.
