I discussed my solution with: ChatGPT 4o.

In general I think this lab is clear to understand and relatively easy to implement (compared to RAFT in particular). 
For the entire lab, debugging the failovers and error handling part took me the longest, which was a bit difficult if 
there is uncleared confusion on how the flow should go (get a usable client from a node try to send request with this 
node  if fail, get another usable node excluding the used ones  try to send request with this node  loop). The other 
major confusion was on copying shard data. I found it helpful to understand the expected behavior of the server in this 
part by reading the test code.  

Since I really want to get the most out of this course, I chose to complete all components of this lab by myself. I am 
very sorry that I turned it in late (again) because I finished the previous RAFT lab later than the specified due date 
so everything got delayed. I really spared my efforts with every assignment of this class, and would really appreciate 
it if I could be considered less penalty for my submission. Thank you so much!!!
